1. install theme:
open git bash to run following command:
1) install by url:
$ rake theme:install git="https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-the-program.git"
2)  If you have obtained a Theme Package in another way, such as zip download, you can manually place it into your ./_theme_packages folder and then run the installer with the name of the theme.
$ rake theme:install name="THEME-NAME"


2. Switch Themes
1) $ rake theme:switch name="the-program"
# for 0.1.0 users `rake switch_theme` still works.
